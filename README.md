## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

## Creating a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. To create a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Create a virtual environment using the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Server

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Django development server:

1. Apply the migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. Create a superuser to access the Django admin (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the application running.
